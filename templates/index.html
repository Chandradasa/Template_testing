          <br> inline tags have no boxes around them ; block takes have boxes</p>
          <p> to add a link use a tag anchor and href = web link<a href= "http://www.bbc.com"> The BBC</a></p>
          <p> to add image use img tag wih attribute src(source)
          </p>
          inline tags do not have space eg padding. block tags eg div is a block has invisible box 
          Span inline can add style.

            <p>When using example code, try use the original code and make small changes </p>
            <p>Also check example code does what you want it to do

      </div>
      <div>
       <h3> OOP object oriented programming </h3>
       <h4>OOP is a design philosophy, everything in OOP is grouped as self sustainable objects</h4>

          Where common properties and methods are grouped into a class. Then we can  use the class (Blueprint) to create different 
          objects or instances.<br>
          <br>
           e.g. class could be vehicle , and subclasses could be  Car, truck , bus. and objects or instances = bmw and mini
           <br>
           classes defines  attributes (data) and behaviour  (actions) <br> similar to CSS class property : value.
           <br>
           attributes can be called properties and  behaviour called methods
           <p>
           OOP is where the  code is split apart into self contained class.  Almost like having smaller programs.  each object represents a different part of the application. each object has its own logic and data.
           </p>
           <p>  OOP allow projects to be divided into object based program development.This is especially useful for large projects with many programmers can focus on individual objects</p>
           <p>
             Objects can include new attributes and  behaviours which allows it to be extensible
           </p>
           <p>
             OOP allows objects to be used many  times, hence reusable.

           </p>
           <p>
             Object Oriented Programming  enables
             <ul>
                <li>Modularity ; self contained</li>
                <li>Extensibility; can be modified</li>
                <li>Reusability ; can be used many times </li>
             </ul>

             <p> Due to the above three factors, OOP has the follow five benefits</p>
             <ol>
                <li>easier to maintain code</li>
                <li>increased productivity </li>
                <li>faster to market</li>
                <li>lower costs</li>
                <li> more time to focus on quality of code</li>

             </ol>
           
            method  is like a function doing something. e.g. moving forward
            <br>
            module is a python file  which can contain many methods.we can import a module and use methods contained in the file.
            <br>
              <h3>OOP   analogy:</h3>
                Learning Karate:  there are various movements; strikes,blocks and kicks. ,<br>

                Kata, uses a set of movements. Theses movements come from Karate techniques. Karate= Class and each kata is an object or instance.
                there are more than 26 katas

             Walking on an empty road has a high latency than a car travelling at 70mph on the same road . <br>
             Bandwidth bits per second. Mbps  amount of information that can be transmitted per unit of time. 
             Eg 6 lane motorway has bigger b/w than 3 lane. <br>

            <p>Bit  is 0 or 1  can be any up or down state. <br>
             4 options needs only 2 bits : try to ask questions when 50% chance
             Every extra bit double the  about of information that can be sent. </p>
            Protocol   Is the language so that source and destination understand each other. <br><br>
             <b>Http. Hypertext transfer protocol. Language of the web</b> <br> <br>
            Client eg when using web browser sends a message GET to a servers to get a web page. <br>
             Server will find web app , then server sends response . Server is specified by the url uniform resource locator .<br> <br>
             <h4>example</h4>

                jinja will load using templates located in current dir <br><br>
                template_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'templates') <br>

              For example title and footer could be used again  and again. <br>
              Templates reduces  repeatable code. When changing part of the base HTML code, changes will be replicated to all other child html files. <br>
              Body will be unique but we can share title and footer. Unique area can be called  by  block content, then endblock <br>
              On infant html call base html. <br><br> 
              { &#37; extends " base.html" &#37;}<br> <br>

         <h3> Programming language of the web</h3>
          To declare a variable always use var infront, note that python did not need this.<br>
          Example: var Lights= document.getElementByClassName ("Light);
        <pre>
          var  variableName = someValue
        </pre>
         Array (lists in Python ) , functions and object (similar to dictionaries in Python  ) all need var when declaring.
        <pre>
         var firstName = "dave ";<br>
         var age = 32;
       </pre>
         console.log(firstName); is similar to print command in Python and good for debugging.<br>
         Need semi colon at the end. Python does not need semi colon. <br>
         Using helper js file , we can replace %data% with variables. <br>
        Call id in html to prepend or append eg <br>
       <p> Arrays have a list of values. var myArray=[item1,item n];</p>
       <h4>JavaScript Strings</h4>
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">JavaScript string methods</a><br>
        <p>
        This website created by Mozilla provides wealth of information on JavaScript. The actual web page focusing on standard built-in string objects.<br>
        When reviewing JavaScript fundamental courses, this website can be used to review coding. <br> <br>
        Reading the code on this website allows better understand on what the code is doing. 
        When reviewing JavaScript string manipulation, this is a 
        good site to compliment courses. Example  when reviewing  JavaScript Basics, varies  coding can be reviewed on website for further clarification.<br>
        Example, how to  convert first letters to capitals
        </p>
        <h3>Object literal notation </h3>
        There are no classes in JavaScript <br>
        Var my Obj = { } ;<br>
        Objects similar to dictionary.<br>
        A property  <br>
        var bio = { "name" : "dave"}; <br>
        $ (" #main"). append(bio.name); <br>
        # calls id <br>
        Able to add properties , by dot notation or bracket. <br>
        var not needed. <br>
        myObj.property=someValue<br>
        <h4>JSON  JavaScript Object Notation </h4>
        Popular and simple format for storing and transferring nested or hierarchical data.<br>
        Should lint JSON to find syntax errors. linter is software that analyzes code for errors <br>

          User requests information from server, then server requests information from other servers.<br>
          XML similar to html, but must have open and closing tag. It is more rigorous than html.<br><br>
          Dom doc object model.To parse xml in Python use <br>
           from xml.com Import minidom, for small amounts of text.<br>

          <h3>APIs allow programmers to interface with other programs </h3>
          <h2>How to be good citizen on the internet.</h2>
          Use a good user-agent. So if you are pounding server, the server owner can contact you.<br>
          Rate-limit yourself. Add import time to slow down requests.<br>
          Other protocals comms across internet<br>
         <ul>

          Example user requests information on countries: population, culture, temperature and holiday packages.<br>
          The server getting the POST, could poll other servers and then manipulate data to pass back to user.<br>
          Course example used  one api to get location from ip address and used another api to generate  a map with pin locators.<br>

          <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twiiter Bootstrap</a>

          Bootstrap requires containers wrapped around  row. Columns need to be in row <br>
          Div class= " container"  fixed width container,   -fluid for spanning entire width.<br>
          Bootstrap is big , can customise  folders needed.<br>
          Eg typography , grid systems, modals <br><br>
          Download files, there will be  minified  files as well. 
          Min files  has no white space , can be downloaded faster. For development normal files are needed <br><br>
          .img -responsive class , allows image to reduce size <br>
          Modal allows extra data when clicked on <br>
          Data-toggle= "modal"   Data -target =# id <br>
          Make a class modal <br>
          <h2>Responsive web design</h2>
          <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud893/l-3523969367/m-3525619348">Udacity :Responsive Web Design Fundamentals</a>
           Mobile market getting bigger,  hence web page needs to be responsive to different devices <br>
          <h3>Viewport</h3> 
          Device Independent Pixels: browser will see DIP, then gets scaled to hardware pixels <br>
          If there is no meta viewport, browser will think  980px DIP when it has only 360 dips. The browser with font-boosting which tries to enlarge some content. A mess.<br><br>
          Meta name ="viewpoint" content="width =device-width,initial-scale=1" <br>
           <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp"><br>w3school:viewpoint</a>
          Use relative widths not absolute eg % not px, to ensure image is scaled to each device. <br>
          In css <br>
          <pre>
          Catch all img, embed, object, video{
          Max-width : 100%;
          }
          Tap targets should be big enough for a finger.  40px x40px   Eg
          nav a , button { 
                  min-width: 48px;
                   min-height: 48px;
          }
          </pre>
          <h3>Start with mobile design then tablet then desktop.</h3>
          Prioritise content and performance.<br>
          Padding em around  button. em seems to be the actual button size scaler.<br>
          Eg 1.5 em = 1.5 x the size of button<br>
          Breakpoints are when the web changes according to the size of  width.<br>
          Breakpoints are an art not a science, as it is subjective on when a break point is required.<br>
          Column changes , 4 common types<br>
          <ul>
            <li>Column drop</li>
            <li>Mostly fluid</li>
            <li>Layout shifter</li>
            <li>Off canvas </li>
          </ul>
         Responsive Image  needs further  investigation 
         <h4>Tables</h4>
        Eg Hidden columns, no more tables , contained tables<br>
        As viewport size gets smaller, unimportant columns can be hidden.<br><br>
        Not good if user needs to see columns that have been hidden<br>
        No more tables : force all table characters to display: block<br><br>
        Wrap  table with div contained_table  and set width :100% and overflow-x :auto;<br>
        Table flows  across small screen.<br><br>
        Comfortable reading, average 65 characters per line <br>
        Font around 16 px<br>
        Line-height: 1.2 em;<br>
        Minor breakpoints: small changes, margins and padding, font sizes<br>
      </div>
     </div>
    </div>
  </div>
